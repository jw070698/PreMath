Shape Description:

Imagine a playground shaped like an "L." The playground can be divided into two rectangles.

Rectangle A: The top part of the "L" is 6 meters long and 3 meters wide.
Rectangle B: The bottom part of the "L" is 4 meters long and 3 meters wide.
Task:

Find the total area of the playground by calculating the area of each rectangle and then adding them together.`]

7 Student A: But look, (..) you did six here, didn’t you? Do //four//
8 Student B: //Mh// (affirmatory). 
9 Student A: f/, no. 
10 Student B: It is supposed to be hundred, ehm
11 Student A: Yes yes but look, you can just do it like this (takes piece of paper) simply ten here (points in one direction) and ten here (points to another). Then you have hundred.
12 Student B: (….) I hate maths.

40 Teacher: So why does that match the side lengths?
41 Student A: Because it is the same, isn’t it, this way (hand from bottom to top) and this way (left to right).

60 Student B: How does the thousand work, I mean this (points at worksheet) here?
61 Teacher: Think about that together. (…) Ayla already found the side length of that thing. (..) And maybe you see something HERE (points to the worksheet) that you can (.) carry on (.) somehow. Something this and this here (.) have in common...
62 Student A: Yes, there always is one, and then not, and then one, and then not.
63 Teacher: Yes, exactly. And then there for example is a row where there is nothing.
64 Student A: Mhm. (Affirmatory)
65 Teacher: And that is actually kind of the same everywhere. 
            And maybe you find something general (.) how you can find it out WITHOUT COUNTING.
66 Student A: So if thirty (..) times thirty is nine hundred (..) nine hundred thirty, (..) nine hundred thirty, 
           thirt/ (5 sec), nine hundred sixty. It has to be nine hundred sixty. See (.) write that down.
           (..) I will now draw these boxes, if nine hundred sixty comes out I was (..) right.
67 Student A: Wow, how many boxes ARE THERE? (..) I think this (.) is this one thousand-thingy, isn’t it, isn’t it, isn’t it?
 
81 Student A: We first (.) calculated the square root with you. And then ehm, we arrived at thirty-two. 
         Then we tried (.) to do thirty-two boxes, top and bottom. We didn’t manage to. 
         Yes, and we got to nine hundred sixty, because we calculated it.
82 Teacher: So what did you calculate to get to the nine hundred sixty?
83 Student A: Yes well, because the book said ehm (.) thirty by thirty is nine hundred, and then we calculated a bit.
