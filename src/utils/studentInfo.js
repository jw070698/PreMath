Shape Description:

Imagine a playground shaped like an "L." The playground can be divided into two rectangles.

Rectangle A: The top part of the "L" is 6 meters long and 3 meters wide.
Rectangle B: The bottom part of the "L" is 4 meters long and 3 meters wide.
Task:

Find the total area of the playground by calculating the area of each rectangle and then adding them together.`]
